## Issue reporting
If you encounter a bug while using nanob.in or Nanobin's Mac app, first search the [issues list](https://github.com/nanobin/docs/issues) to see if it has been reported previously. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- A short and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the issue, including any output from the Console (if applicable). Please place logs either in a code block or share via [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/)
- Steps for reproducing the issue
- Your system information (including OS version, [your device's specifications from EveryMac](https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/), web browser (if nanob.in issue, and Nanobin version (if Nanobin Mac app issue)

Nanobin does not provide support for Hackintosh computers as they're a lot more complicated and issues could be caused by a plethora of things that are out of our pay grade.

#### How to get device specifications from EveryMac
1. Navigate to your system's basic information through this workflow: ` > About This Mac > Overview`
2. Copy the text next to `Serial Number`
3. Go to [EveryMac's Ultimate Mac Lookup](https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/) paste the serial number in the `Enter Mac or Apple Device Identifier:` input field
4. Once the results come up, find which device is yours and click the link
5. Copy the EveryMac device URL and paste it in your issue report

#### Issue closing policy
Issues will only be closed once we implement / fix them, or explicitly say that we can't/won't fixed them. Issues may take a hot minute (forever) to be fixed, so make sure that you are ready to keep them around on your issues list for a long time.
