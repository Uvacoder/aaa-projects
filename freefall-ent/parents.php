                    <p>Freefall has many events that have specific cultures associated with them. This is why if we feel that a certain event may not be suitable for minors, we will make the event's admission for adults only. This could be due to the venue's rules, law, the sale of alcohol, drug use at other shows run by different companies, sexual content, age majority of the majority of attendees, or anything else that we percieve could be harmful to minors. However, if you are unsure if an event may be appropriate for your children and the event is for all ages, please do not hesitate to email us with any questions at <a href="mailto:parents@freefall.co">parents@freefall.co</a>.</p>

On top of that, if you are under the age of 13 you are not allowed to spend the night at the event period.</p>
