            <ul>
                <li><strong>Language proficiency &amp; communication</strong> - The language proficency and communication exam will be started once the applicant responds to our communication requests after they've applied.

If they recieve a 80% or higher they will be allowed on the platform and can begin applying for jobs.</li>
